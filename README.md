# Mechanistic Analysis of Counting in Llama-3-8B-Instruct


Author: [Lihao Sun](https://sites.google.com/uchicago.edu/lihao-sun) (University of Chicago)

This repository implements a pipeline for investigating which layer in large language models (LLMs) maintain a running count of category‚Äêmatching words when processing prompts such as:
> Count the number of words in the following list that match the given type, and put the numerical answer in parentheses.<br>
> Type: fruit<br>
> List: [dog, apple, cherry, bus, cat, grape, bowl]<br>
> Answer: (<br>

The experiments consist of bahavioral (prompt construction + open model evaluations) and mechanistic (linear probe + patching) parts. 

## Behavioral 
### Prompt Construction
> üìÅRelevant Files: prompt_suite.ipynb

We create a synthetic dataset of prompts of the form: 
> Count the number of words in the following list that match the given type,<br>
> and put the numerical answer in parentheses.<br>
> Type: CATEGORY <br>
> List: [w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ..., w_N]<br>
> Answer: (<br>

where:
- CATEGORY is drawn uniformly from a predefined set of semantic categories (‚Äúfruit,‚Äù ‚Äúanimal,‚Äù ‚Äúvehicle,‚Äù ‚Äúinstrument,‚Äù ‚Äúfurniture‚Äù).
- Each word list is of random length between 6 and 12 words, sampled (without replacement) from the union of all category pools. 
- We ensure at least one matching word per list, so that the correct answer is never zero.
- We compute the ground‚Äêtruth integer answer by counting how many list entries belong to the selected category.

### Benchmarking Models
> üìÅRelevant Files: behavioral_eval.ipynb ; behavioral_results/

We evaluate a set of open‚Äêweight LLMs on 5,000 prompts in a zero‚Äêshot regime (no chain‚Äêof‚Äêthought steps, no appended reasoning instructions). Each model is asked exactly the prompt (ending in Answer: (), and we capture its next‚Äêtoken generation(s) to extract the predicted integer.

#### Behavioral Results 

## Mechanistic
### Methodology
We focus on the Llama 3-8B-Instruct model and use a causal-mediation (activation-patching) framework. The analysis proceeds in: 
- Hidden-State Caching and Linear Probing
- Activation Patching and Causal Evaluation

Each phase is explained below.

#### Hidden-State Caching and Linear Probing
In order to study cases where the model demonstrably formed a valid internal count, we filter the predictions file to keep the first N = 200 examples where pred == gold. This yields a subset of prompts where the model's final answer exactly matches the ground truth, ensuring that it likely performed the intended reasoning.

- Hidden State Collection:

  For each of the 200 prompts, we extract hidden states from all 32 transformer layers while the model processes the input list. We align each list word to its token index to track the exact representation used during counting.

- Linear Probe Training:

  For each layer ‚Ñì, we train a Ridge regression model to predict the running count of matching category words (e.g., fruits) up to each list position, using the residual stream at that position.

- Probe Evaluation:

  We compute R¬≤ scores on a held-out validation set to assess how well each layer linearly encodes the current count.

##### Results 


#### Activation Patching and Causal Evaluation
To assess whether the identified layer causally contributes to the model‚Äôs final answer, we perform targeted activation patching.

- Setup:
  
  For each prompt and list index k, we create a prefix-permuted version of the prompt by randomly shuffling the first k+1 words in the list. This changes the running count up to that point, but leaves the rest of the prompt unchanged.

- Patching Procedure:
  
  We extract the hidden state from the permuted run at layer ‚Ñì* (identified from probing) and insert it into the clean run at the corresponding token position. We then let the model finish its forward pass and decode its new final prediction.

- Evaluation:
  
  If the patched model now outputs the counterfactual final count (i.e., the total number of matching items in the permuted list), we mark the patch as successful.
